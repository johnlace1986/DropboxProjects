    <p>Welcome to the online portfolio for Nisbet Photography. We are a husband and wife team based in Peterborough, UK.</p>
    <p>We have recently decided to extend our photography professionally as we have, over many months of planning, come to the conclusion that if we work hard and dedicate ourselves, we could develop a business providing the fun and enjoyment of photography to others, that we ourselves enjoy.</p>
    <p>This has resulted in both Caroline and I taking specific photography training in our own preferred areas and purchasing more professional equipment to compliment the extensive equipment that we already owned.</p>
    <p>We hope that you like what you see on our site and that you will commission us to provide you with images that give you as much pleasure as the images that we take for ourselves.</p>
